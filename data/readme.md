## Data Explanation

Each song/dance pair has its own folder. Each folder should have a text file with the 3d dance data as well as a text file with the ID of the song in the Spotify API.
The text file with 3d dance data has a naming scheme as follows:
ID_DATE_TRACKNAME_ARTISTNAME_[NO. OF 8 COUNTS BEOFRE CLAP].
