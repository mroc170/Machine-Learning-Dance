Touch Designer
-get data from camera
-uses touch designer to encode it and send to pd
-touch designer has built in functions for kinect

OSC messaging protocol, comes over the network


OSC_Kinect_OUT.1.toe


kinect3 - CHOP (channel operator)
- gathers every coordinate point, one object 


-touch designer does the tagging of which point is which joint!!!!!

rename2
- take the colon t out and replace with /z
- that is OSC messaging protocol
- done for use later

oscout1
- lets you specify a network address/port to send to

- need router or ethernet to send to jakes or can use PD on my laptop locally


SNOW USES PD TO
- to code synth


in pd
-dump osc and specify port
send kinectData - wireless connection
routeskeleton.pd --- receives the kinect data and routes only p1 and joint and the dimension



think about kinectRecorder in TouchDesigner
